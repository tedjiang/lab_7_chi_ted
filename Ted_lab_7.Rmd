This: I'm Ted and I'm updating this markdown file.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

```

We are asking: IS there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents?

Hi this is Yirui. Nice to meet you!

Ted: data wrangling and counts

```{r}

get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns)

```
